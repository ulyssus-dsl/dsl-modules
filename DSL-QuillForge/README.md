# DSL QuillForge

The DSL QuillForge is a module that allows for easy management of books and documents in the Dark & Shattered Lands Mud. This module makes it possible to easily design and write copies of books and documents using Mudlet scripts that manage the configuration of the books and documents. This module also allows the books and documents to be viewed in Mudlet directly without a copy of the book, allows for easy reading of existing copies of the books, and searching for copies of the books in containers such as public pits. Existing books and documents in the game can also be cloned into a QuillForge script for easy duplication of them.

DSL QuillForge was written and tested on Mudlet 4.19.1.

## Installation

To install the DSL QuillForge module, download DSL-QuillForge.xml and in Mudlet go to Toolbox -> Module Manager -> Install to install the module.

## Usage

Once the module has been installed, type `quill` to begin using it.
